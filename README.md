About the Tweak: this tweak tries to make the UI not look bright/dark in Light/Dark Mode and to make the whole YouTube Music UI feel more consistent.

1.0.5-2: Updated the tweak by removing Unneeded code and added a few Elements that may be important for the New YouTube Music UI.

## Versions
Low Contrast Mode (Compatibility: YouTube Music v4.47.2-present)
